# Harinezumi
Harinezumi (HZ short) is a on Sonic Dash based Framework for Game Maker 8.1 and Studio 1.4/2

# Description.
Harinezumi is a fork of the Dash Engine (Dash, Revival, SRE, GMate)
with the main goal of making it as accurate to the original games as possible while improving on the base framework to make it easy and bug-free.

Developement on HZ started in 2020 and is the successor to my previous S8E framework, now themed around Sonic Mania.

# What you will need.
You will need the full version of either Game Maker 8.1 or Game Maker Studio 1.4.9999/2.

I highly recommend using Studio for building your game for better compatibility.

# Before starting...
Please check the wiki to get a better understanding of the new tile flag system present in HZ and for additional questions you may have.
