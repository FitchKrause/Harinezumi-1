# Harinezumi
Harinezumi (HZ short) is a on Sonic Dash based Framework for Game Maker 8.1 and Studio 1.4/2

# Description
Harinezumi is a fork of the Dash Engine (Dash, Revival, SRE, GMate)
with the main goal of making it as accurate to the original games as possible and improving on the base framework to make it easy and bug-free.

Developement on HZ started in 2020 and is the successor to my previous S8E framework, now themed around Sonic Mania.
